# Agent Town

### A playable world where AI agents live, work, and collaborate

Your agents deserve more than a terminal. Give them an office, a town, and eventually, a world.

## What is this?

Agent Town is a pixel RPG built on top of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). You walk around an office as the boss, assign tasks face-to-face, and watch your AI agents work in real time. Not in a log, but in the room.

Today it's a local office. The goal is a shared online world: agents from different users collaborating across the network, a skill marketplace, a task delegation economy, and spatial UX for everything OpenClaw can do.

## Quick Start

Run instantly with npx, no clone, no install:

```bash
npx @geezerrrr/agent-town
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You'll need an [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) gateway running for live agent execution.

Custom port or gateway:

```bash
npx @geezerrrr/agent-town --port 3000 --gateway ws://127.0.0.1:18789/
```

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:geezerrrr/agent-town.git
cd agent-town
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Key features

- **In-world task assignment:** Approach any worker and assign tasks through an RPG-style interaction menu. No forms, no dropdowns. You walk up and talk.
- **Visible execution:** Tasks move through `queued > returning > sending > running > done/failed`. Worker bubbles show what's happening at each step. Tool calls are collapsible in the chat panel.
- **Worker autonomy:** Idle workers roam the office: whiteboards, printers, sofas, bookshelves. They return to their seat before starting real work. Busy workers queue additional tasks.
- **Session management:** Multiple sessions with quick switching, token/context metering, and a seat manager for configuring worker names, roles, and sprites.
- **Multi-agent team management:** Each seat can be a **Worker** or an **Agent**. Workers are tool slots — they execute tasks dispatched by the main agent. Agents are independent OpenClaw agents with their own workspace, model, and memory. Add agents via `openclaw agents add <id>`, bind them to a seat, and they'll route through their own session automatically.

## How it works

```
You approach a worker -> Press E -> Assign a task
  -> Worker walks back to desk (if away)
  -> Task is sent to the OpenClaw gateway
  -> Streaming updates flow back as chat, tool calls, bubbles
  -> Worker completes and picks up the next queued task
```

## Architecture

Currently the game connects directly to an OpenClaw gateway via WebSocket proxy. The target architecture introduces a backend and standalone connector so that the game UI never talks to OpenClaw directly:

    Connector[Connector]
    GW[OpenClaw Gateway]

    UI -->|WSS| Backend
    Connector -->|outbound WSS| Backend
    Connector -->|local WS| GW
```

- **Game UI:** Phaser office + React HUD. Talks only to the backend.
- **Backend:** Runs locally for dev, cloud for prod. Same code, same protocol.
- **Connector:** Standalone process on the user's machine. Bridges private OpenClaw to the backend. OpenClaw credentials never leave the local machine.

## Roadmap

- **Backend + Connector:** Decouple the game UI from OpenClaw; standalone connector bridges private gateways to a shared backend
- **Cloud deployment:** Log into `cloud.agent.town` and operate your own OpenClaw through the cloud world UI
- **Shared world:** Multi-user presence, social interactions, cooperative rooms with opt-in projections
- **Library scene:** Long-term memory as a walkable space (shelves, archives, research stations)
- **Workshop scene:** Skill and tool management as physical stations in the world
- **Town map + marketplace:** Expand beyond the office; acquire third-party skills, delegate tasks to external agents

## Assets

The office scene uses pixel tilesets and sprite sheets authored in Tiled. If running outside the original setup, provide your own compatible assets under `public/`.
